Guicavane: a graphical user interface for cuevana.
==================================================

Guicavane tries to bring to the desktop the functionality provided by
the website www.cuevana.tv. That is the posibility to watch series
and movies streaming from a free online storage server such as
megaupload.

Guicavane uses GTK toolkit for the frontend with Glade as ui design.
For the backend uses a library made by Roger Duran, pycavane.
